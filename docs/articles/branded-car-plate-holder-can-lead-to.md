## Branded Car Plate Holder Can Lead To Easy Theft?

While driving to work this morning, something came to my attention.
Not something new, or something unusual, I don't know why, but today
that got me thinking -- Car Plate Holders.

In a lot of countries, your car plate holder is/can be branded with
either your car leasing company logo, your car brand logo,
your country flag, and last but not least, your company logo!
What could that change you'd say? Well, I could think of one use that
would easily make thieves filter cars they want to break into to steal
laptops with valuable data about your company, your customers that you
left in your trunk while having an after-work drink with some colleagues. Sure the
beer is good but does having your entry on [DataLossDB.org](http://datalossdb.org) do any good?

Paranoid? Food for thoughts? Whatever?
