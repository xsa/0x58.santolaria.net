## Sync Birthdays Between Your Google Account and Your Android Native Calendar App 

While the sync between my **HTC Magic** (running `Android Eclair - 2.1`) and my **Google Mail**
account works as expected, by default I was missing my contacts' birthdays information.
To fix this somewhat-lack-of-default-support annoyance, I had to:

1. Go to my `Google Calendar Settings`
1. `Browse interesting calendars`
1. Select the `More` tab
1. Subscribe to  `Contacts' birthdays and events`
1. Sync mobile handheld with Google Mail account

Although this does what I wanted, I'm still looking to enable automatic reminders for birthdays.
If anyone's got any tips to easily enable that in the native calendar app, shoot me an e-mail. Thanks.
