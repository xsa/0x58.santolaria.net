##  Unstatsppd: Your Beers Statistics Distribution by Day of Week

As I had some free time on my hands this week-end, and that I wanted to
know on which day of the week I most enjoy beer drinking, I fired up my
[favorite text editor](http://www.vim.org/) and started `unstatsppd.py`.

No rocket science whatsoever but an easy mean to gather those statistics and display them using the
[Google Charts Tools API](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/).

Code is available here: [https://github.com/xsa/unstatsppd](https://github.com/xsa/unstatsppd)

Prerequisites:
- Python Google Chart: http://pygooglechart.slowchop.com/
- Python Untappd API wrapper: https://github.com/xsa/PyUntappd

Here's an output example with my data:
