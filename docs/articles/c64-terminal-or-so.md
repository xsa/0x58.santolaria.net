## C64 Terminal...Or so...

A couple of days ago I was reinstalling an old laptop (Compaq Armada E500) with OpenBSD -current.
I felt like playing around a little bit as it was a while I had time for that.
A few chi-chat lines later, speaking of the desire to tweak my `xterm(1)` & playing with
the resource settings, our usual suspect -- betabug@#bsdcow -- referred to good
old C64 terminal colors. Say no more:

```
XTerm*Background: DarkSlateBlue
XTerm*Foreground: LightSteelBlue
```
