## JHead to the rescue

Never needed to quickly rotate photos? Of course you did.
Yesterday, I had to rotate a few dozen photos, there came JHead to the rescue.

`$ jhead -autorot *.JPG`

JHead uses the 'Orientation' tag of the Exif header to rotate the image so that it is upright. Easy enough, right?
